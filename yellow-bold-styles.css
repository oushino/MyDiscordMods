/*
  This rule targets any <span> element that is a direct child of a <strong> tag,
  which is itself a descendant of a <div> element whose class attribute starts
  with "message-content_".

  - `div[class^="message-content_"]`: Selects a <div> element whose class
    attribute starts with "message-content_". This is crucial for targeting
    Discord's message containers reliably, as the full class name changes.
  - `strong`: Targets the <strong> element inside the above div.
  - `span`: Targets the <span> element directly inside the <strong> tag.

  The '!important' flag is used to ensure this style overrides any conflicting
  styles from Discord or other themes.

div[class^="message-content_"] strong span {
  color: var(--yellow-bold-color) !important;
}

/*
  Additional considerations (if the above still doesn't cover everything):

  Sometimes, Discord might use a different structure for bold text in other
  parts of the UI (e.g., channel names, user profiles, pop-ups). If you find
  bold text elsewhere that isn't yellow, you'll need to inspect it separately
  and add more specific rules.

  For example, if you find bold text in a different context (like a modal)
  that uses a different parent class:
  .someOtherDiscordContainer_xyz strong span {
    color: var(--yellow-bold-color) !important;
  }
