/*
  This rule targets all <strong> (bold) tags that are descendants of an element
  with the class 'markup'. The 'markup' class is commonly used for the actual
  text content of messages in Discord.

  The '!important' flag is crucial here. It ensures that your custom style
  overrides any other conflicting styles Discord might have, even if they are
  more specific or also use '!important'.

/*
  Troubleshooting Tip:
  If you find that some bold text is still not yellow, it's possible that:
  1. It's not inside a '.markup' element.
  2. It's not an actual <strong> tag, but perhaps a <span> or <div> with
     'font-weight: bold;' applied via a different class.
  In such cases, you'd need to go back to the Developer Tools, inspect that
  specific bold text, and add a new, more precise CSS rule targeting it.
  For example, if you find a class like '.my-custom-bold-text-class', you'd add:

  .my-custom-bold-text-class {
    color: var(--yellow-bold-color) !important;
  }
